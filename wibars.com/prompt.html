### ‚úÖ Final Prompt: Mobile Website With Grid Icon & Right-Side Drawer (Bluechip Style)

 Prompt Title:
 ‚ÄúConvert Existing Website Into Mobile View With Right-Side Grid Menu (Bluechip Style) Without Changing Content‚Äù

 Prompt Body:

I‚Äôve already built a full desktop business website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site has dropdown menus for "Products", "Solutions", "Partners", and more. The design and structure are complete and working well for desktop.

Now I want a mobile-friendly version of the same website, exactly like the behavior and layout used on [https://www.bluechipsolutions.in/](https://www.bluechipsolutions.in/).

üîß IMPORTANT: DO NOT change or disturb any of the existing:

* Page content
* Page sections
* Page layout
* Features, data, or desktop behavior

Only implement a clean, mobile layout.

### üì± Mobile Layout Requirements:

1. Grid Icon for Navigation:

   * Use a 4-dot grid icon (like app launcher) at the top-right corner of the mobile screen.
   * When clicked, it should open a right-side slide-out drawer menu.

2. Slide-Out Drawer Menu:

   * Should include all top-level nav items: Home, Our Company, Technology, Products, Solutions, Partners, Contact Us.
   * Items like Products, Solutions, Partners should include a `+`/`-` toggle to show nested submenu items.
   * Drawer should be scrollable and closeable with an X icon.

3. Dropdown Functionality:

   * Use smooth sliding animation when opening submenus.
   * Ensure touch optimization and responsiveness.
   * Maintain individual toggle state (`+` and `‚àí`) for each menu group.

4. Modern UI/UX:

   * Mobile-friendly design with tech-oriented UI.
   * Use clean spacing, rounded containers, responsive typography, and modern icon sets (e.g., Feather Icons).
   * Maintain same design language as desktop (colors, fonts, shadows).

5. CTA & Footer Inside Drawer:

   * Add ‚ÄúRequest for Demo‚Äù button at the bottom.
   * Include Facebook and LinkedIn icons under the button.

6. Responsiveness:

   * Must support all major mobile widths (320px to 932px).
   * Optimized for devices like iPhone 14 Pro Max.
